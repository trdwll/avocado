# Features
- Markdown support
- Simple design system (everything is in their own html templates for ease of editing)
- Built in Python with Django
- Lightweight


# Set up Process
If you would like to change the default theme, edit the files in `avocado/templates/`.

Open `avocado/settings.py` and edit the following variables:
- `SECRET`KEY` to something random. Keep it secret!
- `BLOG_TITLE` to whatever you want to call your blog.
- `BLOG_DESC` to a short description of your blog.
- `COPYRIGHT` to the current year and your name. Keep blank to remove the copyright.
- `TWTTR_LNK` to whatever your Twitter username is.
- `GITHUB_LNK` to whatever your GitHub username is.
- `FB_LNK` to whatever your Facebook username is.
- `REDDIT_LNK` to whatever your Reddit username is.

Once you're done with the tasks above you're going to want to go read how to put a Django project in production.
Note :- Personally I just throw it in a screen session and forget about it - there's some other ways, but that's the quickest I've found. :)


# Please Note
- Avocado is written in Python, not PHP!
- We're not a team of 100,000 developers so the code is rather clean and simple.


# How to Contribute 
If you would like to contribute to Avocado, see [TODO.md](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/TODO.md) for a list of the current tasks.
I don't think it's necessary to make a full code of conduct on style of code etc; just write good clean code.
See [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) for some basic guidelines.
