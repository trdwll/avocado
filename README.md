- Built in Python with Django
- Lightweight


# Set up Process
If you would like to change the default theme, edit the files in `avocado/templates/`.

Open `avocado/settings.py` and edit the following variables:
- [`SECRET_KEY`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L14) to something random. Keep it secret!
- [`BLOG_TITLE`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L120) to whatever you want to call your blog.
- [`BLOG_DESC`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L121) to a short description of your blog.
- [`COPYRIGHT`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L122) to the current year and your name. Keep blank to remove the copyright.
- [`TWTTR_LNK`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L125) to whatever your Twitter username is.
- [`GITHUB_LNK`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L126) to whatever your GitHub username is.
- [`FB_LNK`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L127) to whatever your Facebook username is.
- [`REDDIT_LNK`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/avocado/settings.py#L128) to whatever your Reddit username is.

Once you're done with the tasks above you're going to want to go read how to put a Django project in production.
Note :- Personally I just throw it in a screen session and forget about it - there's some other ways, but that's the quickest I've found. :)


# Please Note
- Avocado is written in Python, not PHP!
- We're not a team of 100,000 developers so the code is rather clean and simple.


# How to Contribute 
If you would like to contribute to Avocado, see [`TODO.md`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/TODO.md) for a list of the current tasks.
I don't think it's necessary to make a full code of conduct on style of code etc; just write good clean code.
See [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) for some basic guidelines.
